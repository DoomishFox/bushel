# bushel
Bushel is a bare-bones, self-contained digital gardening system. A digital garden is kind of like a wiki; a space for one to write small interlinked documents without the rigid structure of a blog. This is a modern rewrite of [this](https://github.com/DoomishFox/bushel-app) repository because maintaining it filled me with dread.
